Music:
	Let most music data be in a single object that can then be passed around.
	Load data from multiple files.

Synth:
	Modules
		Distributer: Takes the weighted average of the input and normalizes it to 1, then distributes it to the outputs depending on their weights.
		Flip: *-1.
		Sender: Sends the signal to a reciever, which then outputs it after a delay.
		Reciever: Recieves signal from a sender and outputs it after a delay.
		Delay: Delays the signal.
	Fix weird sounds in synth.
	Stuff like LFOs and Envelopes.
	Move Synth to seperate project when ModuleBoard has been tested. Add project to GitHub.
	Make all Connections FlexConnections?

Other:
	Expand data handling capabilities.
